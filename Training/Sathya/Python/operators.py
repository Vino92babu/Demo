# Arithmetic Operators:
# + --> Addition
# - --> Subtraction
# * --> Muliplication
# / --> Division 
# % --> Modulus
# // -->Floor Division
# ** --> Exponentiation

# A = 10 
# B = 3
# # print(A+B)
# # print(A-B)
# print(A*B)
# # print(A/B)
# # print(A%B)
# # print(A//B)
# print(A**B)


# Comparision / Relational Operators

# == --> Equal to 
# != --> Not Equal to
# > --> Greater than
# < --> Lesser Than
# <= --> Lesser than or equal to
# >= --> Greater than or equal to

# print(A==B)
# print(A!=B)
# print(A>B)
# print(A<B)
# print(A<=B)
# print(A>=B)

# Logical Operators:


# and 
# or
# not

# Assignment Operators

# These opertaors are used to assign the values to variables

# = --> Assign --> A = 6
# += --> Add & assign --> A+=5 --> (equalto A=A+5)
# -= --> Sub & Assign --> A-=5
# *= --> Mult& Assign --> A*=5
# /= --> div & Assign --> A/=5
# %= --> mod & Assign --> A%=5
# **= --> expo & Assign --> A**=5
# //= --> FLR div & Assign --> A//=5

# A = 6
# A+=5
# print(A)

# Identity Operators
# is --> Returs "True" if both Variables are same with Same obj
# is not

# A = [1,2,3]
# B = [1,2,3]
# C = A

# print(A is B)
# print(A is C)
# print(A is not B)

# Membership Operators

# in 
# not in 

# A = [1,2,2,3,3,3,3]
# print(3 not in A)
