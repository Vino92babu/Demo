# t1 = [] --> list 
# t2 = () --> tuple 

# t1 = (10,'rise',4.4,'CSE',20)
# t2 = ()

# print(t1[2])
# print(t1[1:3])

# Update tuble --> Tuples are immutatable , which means you cannot update or change the value of tuple element.

# delete --> Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. but to explicity remove an entire tuple, jus use the 'del' statement.

# Basic Operations 
# len()
# Concattenantiob()
# repetation()
# membership () --> 'in'

# print(t1.count(20))
